# # Fitting model parameters in a 1D spin-1 ferromagnetic chain

using Sunny, LinearAlgebra, GLMakie, Optim

# In this Example, we consider a 1D chain of spin-1 sites.
# The sites along the chain interact via a ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor
# interaction ``J\sum_{\langle i,j\rangle} \mathbf{S}_i \cdot \mathbf{S}_j``, with ``J < 0``.
# By default, the ground state would be ferromagnetic and highly degenerate, since the spins
# can align in any direction.
# An on-site interaction, ``D\sum_i (S^z_i)^2`` breaks this isotropy by making it easier for
# the spins to align in the ``\pm z`` direction than in any other orientation.
# Thus, the entire Hamiltonian is:
#
# ``\mathcal{H} = \overbrace{J\sum_{\langle i,j\rangle} \mathbf{S}_i \cdot \mathbf{S}_j}^{\text{Ferromagnetic}}\;\;\;\;\;\; \overbrace{-D\sum_i (S^z_i)^2}^{\text{Easy-axis single-ion anisotropy}}``
#
# The goal of this Example is to illustrate how to determine the parameters ``J`` and ``D``
# from "experiment" data by fitting using Sunny's implementation of Linear Spin Wave Theory.
# In our case, the "experiment" data will actually be simulation data produced
# using Landau-Lifschitz dynamics.

# ## Creating simulated "experiment" data using Landau-Lifschitz dynamics

# Our simulated data will use ground truth values ``J_0 = -1\,\text{meV}`` and ``D_0 = 10\,\text{meV}`` with a lattice spacing ``a = 10`` angstrom.

# We begin with a 1D chain of spin-1 sites along the ``x`` direction.

## Establish geometry of the unit cell.
## "P1" is required due to the rotational symmetry about the
## x-axis being broken.

## Scalar J indicates J*(Sᵢ⋅Sⱼ)

## Interaction is with the left and right next neighbor along the chain (x-direction)

# we are ready to generate the intensity data.
# Since this is supposed to represent an experiment, the intensity data will go in a histogram:

SIMULATED_EXPERIMENT_HISTOGRAM_PARAMS = unit_resolution_binning_parameters(sc)

# Here's what the experiment data looks like:

formula = intensity_formula(sc,:perp;kT)
is, counts = intensities_binned(sc,SIMULATED_EXPERIMENT_HISTOGRAM_PARAMS,formula)

SIMULATED_EXPERIMENT_DATA = (is ./ counts)[:,1,1,:]

f = Figure()#hide
ax = Axis(f[1,1])#hide
heatmap!(ax,bcs[1],bcs[4],log10.(SIMULATED_EXPERIMENT_DATA))
f#hide

# ## Fitting to the experiment data

# To fit this data, we first model the known aspects of the system in Sunny.
# The first steps are the same whether we are simulating a known system or modelling an
# unknown system:

## Same as before
chain_spacing = 10. # Angstrom
latvecs = chain_spacing * I(3)
one_dimensional_chain = Crystal(latvecs,[[0,0,0]],"P1")
chain_length = 16 # Number of atoms
latsize = (chain_length,1,1) # 1D chain is Nx1x1 lattice
spin_one_chain = System(one_dimensional_chain, latsize, [SpinInfo(1,S=1,g=2)], :SUN)



# Originally, the next step would have been to configure the hamiltonian by
# specifying the ``J`` and ``D`` values. However, since these are unknowns,
# we will avoid using them as long as possible, and instead proceed to set up the
# bonds, spin operators, and `Langevin` integrator--none of which require the values:

Δt = 0.05
λ = 0.1
kT = 0. # LSWT uses zero temperature
langevin = Langevin(Δt; kT, λ);

nearest_neighbor_right = Bond(1,1,(1,0,0))
nearest_neighbor_left = Bond(1,1,(-1,0,0))

# After this setup work is done *once*, we create a function `forward_problem(J_trial,D_trial)`
# which will compute the Linear Spin Wave Theoretic spectrum at the trial values of the
# ``J`` and ``D`` fitting parameters.
# In other words, the part of the original calculation which depends on the fitting
# parameters gets wrapped into a function:

function forward_problem(J_trial, D_trial)

  ## Ensure there is no phase transition (or else LSWT will throw errors)
  J_trial = min(J_trial,0)
  D_trial = max(D_trial,0)

  ## Uses J_trial
  set_exchange!(spin_one_chain,J_trial,nearest_neighbor_right)
  set_exchange!(spin_one_chain,J_trial,nearest_neighbor_left)

  ## Uses D_trial
  set_onsite_coupling!(spin_one_chain, -D_trial*Sz^2, 1)

  ## Perform spin wave calculation, continued below...

#+
# Note that `forward_problem` refers to variables defined outside
# of the scope of the function. This allows us to reuse those variables in each call to
# `forward_problem`, without reconstructing them each time. In general, the more that is known
# about the system you are modelling, the later in the code `function forward_problem(...)` can be
# inserted, and the more setup work can be re-used.
#
# !!! tip "`forward_problem` is a closure"
#     In computer progrogramming parlance, `forward_problem` is said to 'capture' variables such
#     as `spin_one_chain` from the enviroment. Since the result of calling `forward_problem` depends
#     not only on `J_trial` and `D_trial`, but also on `spin_one_chain`, it's no longer a function
#     of only its arguments.
#
#     Since `forward_problem` is not a closed system, but
#     `forward_problem + (captured variables)` _is_ a closed system, the latter is called 
#     the 'closure' of the former.

# ## Spin wave calculation

# We can leverage our knowledge that the ground state should be ferromagnetic
# to simplify the spin wave calculation. Since the ferrommagnetic unit cell is just one site,
# the simplified system is extremely simple:

  ## ... perform spin wave calculation, continued from above.
  one_site_system = reshape_supercell(spin_one_chain,[1 0 0; 0 1 0; 0 0 1])

#+
# After restricting to a single site, it's best to re-thermalize the system
# at zero temperature to ensure a good classical ground state for LSWT:

  langevin.kT = 0.
  nStep = 1_000
  for _ in 1:nStep
      step!(one_site_system, langevin)
  end

#+
# The spin wave intensity data must be placed in a histogram with the same parameters
# as the experiment data, in order to ensure a good comparision.
#
# The kernel and `intensities_bin_centers` used here are temporary, until a better
# binning method is written.

  swt = SpinWaveTheory(one_site_system)
  formula = intensity_formula(swt,:perp; kernel = lorentzian(0.5))
  params = SIMULATED_EXPERIMENT_HISTOGRAM_PARAMS
  is_swt = Sunny.intensities_bin_centers(swt, params, formula)

  return is_swt[:,1,1,:]
end # end of forward_problem

# We can see the different possible results from LSWT by plotting the dispersion:

function plot_forward(J,D)
  is_swt = forward_problem(J,D)
  bcs = axes_bincenters(SIMULATED_EXPERIMENT_HISTOGRAM_PARAMS)
  heatmap(bcs[1],bcs[4],log10.(is_swt))
end

plot_forward(-1,10)

#

plot_forward(-6,2)

#

plot_forward(-0.01,15)

# Now, we can easily define a least-squares loss function comparing the "experiment" data to the LSWT result:

function get_loss(parameters)
  J,D = parameters
  is_swt = forward_problem(J,D)
  sqrt(sum(abs2.(SIMULATED_EXPERIMENT_DATA .- is_swt)))
end

# Sweeping the parameters over a range containing the true value reveals
# that the loss is minimized near the true parameters (dot).
# The minimum loss is not exactly at the ground truth parameters in this case.
# Gradient descent (finite-differenced) can be used to find the actual minimizer:

nJ = 30
nD = 35
loss_landscape = zeros(Float64,nJ,nD)
Js = range(-2,0,length=nJ)
Ds = range(8,12,length=nD)
for (ij,J) in enumerate(Js)
  for (id,D) in enumerate(Ds)
    loss_landscape[ij,id] = get_loss([J,D])
  end
end
