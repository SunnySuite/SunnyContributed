# In this tutorial, we will walk through a first example in Sunny and calculate
# the spin dynamical properties of the Heisenberg pyrochlore antiferromagnet and
# apply this knowledge to MgCr2O4 and ZnCr2O4, which are known to approximate
# this model. Relevant publications include:

# ## Setting up Julia
# To run the examples in the tutorial, you will need a working installation of
# the Julia programming language and the Sunny package. Some useful references
# for getting started are:

# 
# https://sunnysuite.github.io/Sunny.jl/dev/
#
# We will begin by loading the relevant packages.

using Sunny # The main package
using GLMakie # Plotting package

# ## Setting up the crystal structure
# 
# Before specifying the interactions of our system, we first must set up the
# crystal. We will begin by specifying the pyrochlore lattice (illustrated
# below) in the manner that is typical of theorists.

# ### "Theorist" Method

# In this approach, we directly define the lattice vectors and specify the position
# of each atom in fractional coordinates.
latvecs = lattice_vectors(8.3342, 8.3342, 8.3342, 90, 90, 90)
positions = [[0.875, 0.625, 0.375],
             [0.625, 0.125, 0.625],
             [0.875, 0.875, 0.125],  
             [0.625, 0.875, 0.375],  
             [0.875, 0.125, 0.875],  
             [0.625, 0.625, 0.125],  
             [0.875, 0.375, 0.625],  
             [0.625, 0.375, 0.875],  
             [0.375, 0.625, 0.875],  
             [0.125, 0.125, 0.125],  
             [0.375, 0.875, 0.625],  
             [0.125, 0.875, 0.875],  
             [0.375, 0.125, 0.375],  
             [0.125, 0.625, 0.625],  
             [0.375, 0.375, 0.125],  
             [0.125, 0.375, 0.375]];
types = ["B" for _ in positions]
xtal_pyro   = Crystal(latvecs, positions; types) # We will call this crystal the Theoretical Pyrochlore

# To examine the result interactively, we can call `view_crystal`.

view_crystal(xtal_pyro, 3.2) 

# ### "Experimentalist" Method #1 (Incorrect)
# A real crystal is more complicated than this, however, and we will now
# construct the system using the actual CIF file of MgCr2O4 from ICSD. This can
# be done by copying over the data from a CIF file by hand, but this can be
# dangerous, as shown below.

latvecs   = lattice_vectors(8.3342, 8.3342, 8.3342, 90, 90, 90)
positions = [[0.1250, 0.1250, 0.1250],
             [0.5000, 0.5000, 0.5000],
             [0.2607, 0.2607, 0.2607]]
types = ["Mg","Cr","O"]
xtal_mgcro_1 = Crystal(latvecs, positions; types)

# Sunny returned a valid crystal, but it did get right space group for MgCr2O4.
# This can be fixed by modifying the input to include the space group and the
# setting.
# 
# ### "Experimentalist" Method #2 (Correct)

# As above, we will define the crystal structure of MgCr2O4 by copying the info
# from a CIF file, but we will also specify the space group and setting
# explicitly.
 
latvecs    = lattice_vectors(8.3342, 8.3342, 8.3342, 90, 90, 90)
positions  = [[0.1250, 0.1250, 0.1250],
              [0.5000, 0.5000, 0.5000],
              [0.2607, 0.2607, 0.2607]]
types      = ["Mg","Cr","O"]
spacegroup = 227 # Space Group Number 
setting    = "2" # Space Group setting
xtal_mgcro_2 = Crystal(latvecs, positions, spacegroup; types, setting)

# This result is correct, but at this point we might as well import the CIF file
# directly, which we now proceed to do.

# ### "Experimentalist" Method #3 (Correct -- if your CIF file is)

# To import a CIF file, simply give the path to `Crystal`. One may optionally
# specify a precision parameter to apply to the symmetry analysis.

cif = "MgCr2O4_160953_2009.cif"
xtal_mgcro_3 = Crystal(cif; symprec=0.001)

# Finally, we wish to restrict attention to the magnetic atoms in the unit cell
# while maintaining symmetry information for the full crystal, which is required
# to determine the correct exchange and g-factor anisotropies. This can be
# achieved with the `subcrystal` function.

xtal_mgcro = subcrystal(xtal_mgcro_2,"Cr")

# ## Making a `System` and assigning interactions 
# ### Making a `System`
# Before assigning any interactions, we first have to set up a `System` using
# our `Crystal`.

dims = (6, 6, 6)  # Supercell dimensions 
spininfos = [SpinInfo(1, S=3/2, g=2)]  # Specify spin information, note that all sites are symmetry equivalent 
sys_pyro = System(xtal_pyro, dims, spininfos, :dipole)    # Make a system in dipole (Landau-Lifshitz) mode on pyrochlore lattice
sys_mgcro = System(xtal_mgcro, dims, spininfos, :dipole); # Same on MgCr2O4 crystal

# To understand what interactions we may assign to this system, we have to
# understand the the symmetry properties of the crystal, which we turn to next.
#
# ### Symmetry analysis for exchange and single-ion anisotropies
# 
# `print_symmetry_table` reports all the exchange interactions, single-site
# anisotropies, and g-factors allowed on our crystal. It takes a `Cyrstal` and a
# distance. We'll look at both the "theorist's" pyrochlore lattice,

print_symmetry_table(xtal_pyro, 5.9) 

# and for the the MgCrO4 crystal,

print_symmetry_table(xtal_mgcro, 6.0) 

# Note that the exchange anisotropies allowed on the the pyrochlore lattice are
# slightly different from those on the MgCr2O4 cyrstal due to the role of Mg
# and O in the bonds. Also note that Sunny has correctly identified the two
# inequivalent bonds 3a and 3b having the same length. A question may arises to
# know which bond is J3a and which is J3b, let's plot the structure.
 
view_crystal(xtal_mgcro, 5.9)
 
# The crystal viewer shows that the second interaction -- cyan color with
# distance of 5.89Å -- is in fact the one hopping through a chromium site,
# meaning it is J3a! We will need to be careful with that later.
#
# ### Building the exchange interactions for our system
#
# We begin by setting the scale of our exchange interactions on each bond. 

J1      = 3.27  # value of J1 in meV from Bai's PRL paper
J_pyro  = [1.00,0.000,0.000,0.000]*J1    # pure nearest neighbor pyrochlore
J_mgcro = [1.00,0.0815,0.1050,0.085]*J1; # further neighbor pyrochlore relevant for MgCr2O4
## val_J_mgcro = [1.00,0.000,0.025,0.025]*val_J1; # this is a funny setting from Conlon-Chalker

# These values are then assigned to their corresponding bonds with `set_exchange!`.

## === Assign exchange interactions to pyrochlore system ===
set_exchange!(sys_pyro, J_pyro[1], Bond(1, 3, [0,0,0])) # J1
set_exchange!(sys_pyro, J_pyro[2], Bond(1, 2, [0,0,0])) # J2
set_exchange!(sys_pyro, J_pyro[3], Bond(2, 6, [0,0,0])) # J3a
set_exchange!(sys_pyro, J_pyro[4], Bond(1, 5, [0,0,0])) # J3b

## === Assign exchange interactions to MgCr2O4 system ===
set_exchange!(sys_mgcro, J_mgcro[1], Bond(1, 2, [0,0,0]))  # J1
set_exchange!(sys_mgcro, J_mgcro[2], Bond(1, 7, [0,0,0]))  # J2
set_exchange!(sys_mgcro, J_mgcro[3], Bond(1, 3, [0,0,0]))  # J3a -- Careful here!  
set_exchange!(sys_mgcro, J_mgcro[4], Bond(1, 3, [1,0,0])); # J3b -- And here!

# We will not be assigning any single-ion anisotropies, so we have finished
# specifying our models. For good measure, we will set both systems to a random
# (infinite temperature) initial condition.

randomize_spins!(sys_pyro)
randomize_spins!(sys_mgcro);

# ## Cooling our `System` amd calculating the instantaneous and dynamic structure factors at the final temperature ##
# 
# We begin by thermalizing our system at a particular temperature. We will
# accomplish this by running Langevin dynamics. To do this, we must set up a
# Langevin integrator.

Δt = 0.05  # Integration time step in meV^-1
λ  = 0.1   # Phenomenological damping parameter
kT = 1.8   # Desired temperature in meV
langevin = Langevin(Δt; λ, kT); # Construct integrator

# We can now thermalize our systems by running the integrator.

# systems after themalization. First the pyrochlore,

# ### Instantaneous structure factor from a dynamical structure factor

# Finally, we note that the instant structure factor can be calculated from the
# dynamical structure factor. We simply call `instant_intensities` rather than
# `intensities`. This will calculate the instantaneous structure factor from
# from ``𝒮(𝐪,ω)`` by integrating out ``ω`` . An advantage of doing this (as
# opposed to using `instant_correlations`) is that Sunny is able to apply a
# temperature- and energy-dependent intensity rescaling before integrating out
# the dynamical information. The results of this approach are more suitable for
# comparison with experimental data.
