# # 2. Spin wave simulations of CoRh‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ

# This tutorial illustrates the conventional spin wave theory of dipoles. We
# consider a simple model of the diamond-cubic crystal CoRh‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ, with parameters
# extracted from [Ge et al., Phys. Rev. B 96,
# 064413](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.96.064413).

# Construct a diamond [`Crystal`](@ref) in the conventional (non-primitive)
# cubic unit cell. Sunny will populate all eight symmetry-equivalent sites when
# given the international spacegroup number 227 ("Fd-3m") and the appropriate
# setting. For this spacegroup, there are two conventional translations of the
# unit cell, and it is necessary to disambiguate through the `setting` keyword
# argument. (On your own: what happens if `setting` is omitted?)

# In a running Julia environment, the crystal can be viewed interactively using
# [`view_crystal`](@ref).

# Construct a [`System`](@ref) with quantum spin ``S=3/2`` constrained to the
# space of dipoles. Including an antiferromagnetic nearest neighbor interaction
# `J` will favor N√©el order. To optimize this magnetic structure, it is
# sufficient to employ a magnetic lattice consisting of a single crystal unit
# cell, `latsize=(1,1,1)`. Passing an explicit random number `seed` will ensure
# repeatable results.

# In the ground state, each spin is exactly anti-aligned with its 4
# nearest-neighbors. Because every bond contributes an energy of $-JS^2$, the
# energy per site is $-2JS^2$. In this calculation, a factor of 1/2 avoids
# double-counting the bonds. Due to lack of frustration, direct energy
# minimization is successful in finding the ground state.

# For numerical efficiency, it is helpful to work with the smallest possible
# magnetic supercell; in this case, it is the primitive cell. The columns of the
# 3√ó3 `shape` matrix define the lattice vectors of the primitive cell as
# multiples of the conventional, cubic lattice vectors. After transforming the
# system with [`reshape_supercell`](@ref), the energy per site remains the same.

# Now estimate ``ùíÆ(ùê™,œâ)`` with [`SpinWaveTheory`](@ref) and an
