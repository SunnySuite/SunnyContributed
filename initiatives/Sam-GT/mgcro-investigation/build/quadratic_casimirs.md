## Background: The Killing Form and its associated Quadratic Casimir

A Lie algebra $L$ is a vector space with a bracket operation $[\cdot,\cdot] : L \times L \to L$ satisfying certain properties.
Since Lie algebra elements are often square matrices, it will be convenient to flatten them into vectors to treat them using linear algebra:

````julia
matrix_to_flat(M) = M[:]
flat_to_matrix(v) = reshape(v,Int64(sqrt(length(v))),Int64(sqrt(length(v))))
````

The partially applied bracket $\operatorname{ad}_X = [X,\cdot] : L \to L$ (where $X \in L$) is called the *adjoint representation* of $L$.
In the extremely common case that the bracket operation is the matrix commutator, we can easily write down a matrix representation of $\operatorname{ad}_X$ with respect to some basis:

````julia
function basis_to_transformation_matrix(basis)
  basis = matrix_to_flat.(basis)
  mat_size = length(basis[1])
  basis_elems = length(basis)

  # A matrix mapping (a,b,c) -> a * basis[1] + b * basis[2] + c * basis[3]
  [basis[i][j] for j = 1:mat_size, i = 1:basis_elems]
end

function adX_matrep(X,basis)
  M = basis_to_transformation_matrix(basis)
  adX = zeros(ComplexF64,length(basis),length(basis))
  for j = 1:length(basis)
    adX[:,j] = M \ matrix_to_flat(X * basis[j] - basis[j] * X)
  end
  adX
end
````

Since $\operatorname{ad}_X$ is just a linear map, we can multiply it with itself and take a trace, $B(X,Y) = \operatorname{tr}(\operatorname{ad}_X \operatorname{ad}_Y)$, which defines the Killing form $B$:

````julia
function killing_form(basis)
  B = zeros(ComplexF64,length(basis),length(basis))
  ad = map(X -> adX_matrep(X,basis),basis)
  for i = 1:length(basis), j = 1:length(basis)
    B[i,j] = tr(ad[i] * ad[j])
  end
  round.(B;digits = 12) # Chop tiny numbers
end
````

````

````

If $\{A,B,C\}$ is a basis for $L$, then $2A-4B$ is in $L$, but none of $AB$, $AB - BA$, or $C^2$ is in $L$, in the same way that $\hat x\hat y$ is not in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
In order to make sense of these formal products of Lie algebra elements, one needs to consider the so-called Universal Enveloping Algebra (UEA) $U(L)$, which is the free algebra over $L$ (meaning arbitrary products of elements of $L$ are allowed), but quotiented by the relation $[X,Y] = XY-YX$ (meaning that the formal expression $AB - BA$ is considered equal to whatever $[A,B]$ evaluates to).

Within any Lie algebra (including a UEA), the *center* is the subspace of the Lie algebra that commutes with everything: $X$ is in the center if and only if $[X,Y] = 0$ for all $Y$.
The term "Casimir" sometimes refers to simply *any* element of the center of a Lie algebra, but we will be interested in defining a specific conventional (and basis-independent) Casimir element.

Given a Lie algebra $L$, the *Killing form-derived quadratic casimir* is the following element of UEA of $L$: $\Omega \equiv \sum_{ij} [B^{-1}]^{ij} X^i X^j$ where $[B^{-1}]^{ij}$ is the inverse matrix of $B_{ij}$ in any basis $\{X^i\}_i$.

````julia
function killing_casimir(basis; B = killing_form(basis))
  C = (permutedims(basis) * inv(B) * basis)[1]
  round.(C;digits = 12) # Chop tiny numbers
end

# Example: SU(2)

The su(2) Lie algebra consists of real linear combinations of $S^x$, $S^y$ and $S^z$ (defined as half the pauli matrices), with the commutation relations $[S^x, S^y] = iS^z$ (pauli matrices would have $2i$ instead of $i$) and so on.

````julia
su2 = spin_matrices(1/2)
@assert su2[1] * su2[2] - su2[2] * su2[1] ≈ im * su2[3] # Check commutation relation
````

The center of $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ is empty (only includes zero).
The Killing form is diagonal, $B(S^i,S^j) = 2\delta^{ij}$.

````julia

````
3×3 Matrix{ComplexF64}:
  2.0-0.0im  -0.0-0.0im   0.0-0.0im
 -0.0-0.0im   2.0-0.0im  -0.0-0.0im
  0.0-0.0im  -0.0-0.0im   2.0-0.0im
````

The UEA $U(\mathfrak{su}(2))$ consists of arbitrary spin polynomials $[S^x]^2$, $[S^y]^3S^x - 4 S^z$, etc, with only the commutation relations imposed (and *no* further "coincidental" representation-dependent relations like $[S^x]^2 = I$ imposed).
The Killing form-derived quadratic casimir of su(2) is $\frac{1}{2}S^2 \equiv \frac{1}{2}([S^x]^2 + [S^y]^2 + [S^z]^2)$:

````julia

 0.375+0.0im    0.0+0.0im
   0.0+0.0im  0.375+0.0im
````

We will now demonstrate that this is basis independent.
Consider first the Pauli matrices $\sigma^i = 2 S^i$:

````julia
pauli = 2 .* su2
killing_form(pauli)
````

````
3×3 Matrix{ComplexF64}:
  8.0-0.0im  -0.0-0.0im   0.0-0.0im
 -0.0-0.0im   8.0-0.0im  -0.0-0.0im
  0.0-0.0im  -0.0-0.0im   8.0-0.0im
````

The killing form is different; but the casimir is the same:

````julia
@assert killing_casimir(su2) ≈ killing_casimir(pauli)
````

Next, consider the ladder basis $(S^z, S^+, S^-)$, where the killing form is even off-diagonal:

````julia
ladder = [su2[3], su2[1] + im * su2[2], su2[1] - im * su2[2]]
Sz, Splus, Sminus = ladder

# Verify ladder operator properties
@assert Sz * Splus - Splus * Sz ≈ +Splus
@assert Sz * Sminus - Sminus * Sz ≈ -Sminus

 0.0+0.0im  0.0+0.0im  4.0+0.0im
 0.0+0.0im  4.0+0.0im  0.0+0.0im
````

Yet the casimir is the same:

````julia
killing_casimir(ladder)
````

````
2×2 Matrix{ComplexF64}:
 0.375+0.0im    0.0+0.0im
   0.0+0.0im  0.375+0.0im
````

In all representations of su(2), i.e. for any spin $S$, the killing form-derived quadratic casimir is $S(S+1)/2$:

````julia
println()
println("su(2) representations and their casimir values:")
for S = (1/2):(1/2):5
  spinS = spin_matrices(S)
  C = killing_casimir(spinS)
  @assert C ≈ (S*(S+1)/2) * I(Int64(2S+1))
  casimir = Float64(C[1,1])
  println("S = $(Sunny.number_to_math_string(S)), S(S+1)/2 = $casimir")
end
````

````

su(2) representations and their casimir values:
S = 1/2, S(S+1)/2 = 0.375
S = 1, S(S+1)/2 = 1.0
S = 3/2, S(S+1)/2 = 1.875
S = 2, S(S+1)/2 = 3.0
S = 5/2, S(S+1)/2 = 4.375
S = 3, S(S+1)/2 = 6.0
S = 7/2, S(S+1)/2 = 7.875
S = 4, S(S+1)/2 = 10.0
S = 9/2, S(S+1)/2 = 12.375
S = 5, S(S+1)/2 = 15.0

````

## Stevens Operator Bases

The $N^2 - 1$ non-identity stevens operators form a basis for the defining representation of su(N). We can collect them into a basis:

````julia
function stevens_basis(S; Smax = S)
  O = stevens_matrices(S)
  basis = Vector{Any}(undef,0)
  for n = 1:Int64(2Smax)
    for k = -n:n
      push!(basis,O[n,k])
    end
  end
  basis
end
````

````
stevens_basis (generic function with 1 method)
````

Meanwhile, the 0,0 stevens operator is the identity matrix. Since the quadratic casimir of su(2) is always a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, `print_stevens_expansion(killing_casimir(spin_matrices(S)))` is a convenient way to print the quadratic casimir constant:

````julia
println()
print("For S = 5, Ω = ")
print_stevens_expansion(killing_casimir(spin_matrices(5)))
````

````

For S = 5, Ω = 15

````

Using the Stevens operators, we can compute Killing forms and derive quadratic casimir invariants from them.
Note that, in the su(N) case, the quadratic means quadratic in the su(N) generators, *not* in the spin operators.

Since the Killing form is always diagonal in the Steven's operator basis, we just need the numbers on the diagonal:

````julia
diag(killing_form(stevens_basis(3/2)))

Using S = Inf to have Sunny produce spin polynomials, we can compute the killing form-derived quadratic casimirs in spin polynomial form.
First, we do this for S = 1/2:

````julia
# Compute the Killing form numerically, using numerical stevens matrices
B_su2 = killing_form(stevens_basis(1/2)) # = diag(2,2,2)

# Compute the casimir operator symbolically
Ω = killing_casimir(stevens_basis(Inf;Smax = 1/2); B = real.(B_su2))
println()
println("su(2): Ω = $(round(Ω,digits=5))")
````

````

su(2): Ω = 0.5*𝒮ˣ^2 + 0.5*𝒮ʸ^2 + 0.5*𝒮ᶻ^2

````

The output expression, $\Omega = \frac{1}{2}\sum_i [S^i]^2$, takes place the UEA.
Recall that for our usual spin-1/2 representation, we have $[S^i]^2 = \frac{1}{4}$ for $i=x,y,z$, so $\Omega = \frac{1}{2}(3 \times \frac{1}{4}) = 3/8$, which agrees with the $S(S+1)/2 = 0.375$ value from earlier.

Plugging in the spin-1/2 representation for the $S^i$ makes this quantum mechanical.
We could instead evaluate this spin polynomial by inserting the classical x,y,z components of the spin dipole to find the classical version: $\Omega = \frac{1}{2}\lvert S\rvert^2 = 0.125 \neq 0.375$ (assuming $\lvert S \rvert = \frac{1}{2}$ for spin-1/2, i.e. $\kappa = 1$).
Sunny can do part of this computation for us, by writing $\Omega$ as a polynomial in $\lvert S\rvert^2$, via printing the stevens expansion, which is just the prefactor to the identity matrix O[0,0]:

````julia
print("  stevens: ")
print_stevens_expansion(Ω)
````

````
  stevens: (1/2)𝒮²

````

The situation is similar but more complicated for spin-1:

````julia
B_su3 = killing_form(stevens_basis(1)) # = diag(12,12,12,12,3,36,3,12)
Ω = killing_casimir(stevens_basis(Inf;Smax = 1); B = real.(B_su3))
println()
println("su(3): Ω = (1/36) * [$(round(Ω * 36,digits = 5))]")
print("  stevens: ")
print_stevens_expansion(Ω)
````

````

su(3): Ω = (1/36) * [3.0*𝒮ˣ^2 + 3.0*𝒮ʸ^2 + 3.0*𝒮ᶻ^2 + 4.0*𝒮ˣ^4 + 8.0*𝒮ʸ^2*𝒮ˣ^2 + 4.0*𝒮ʸ^4 + 8.0*𝒮ᶻ^2*𝒮ˣ^2 + 8.0*𝒮ᶻ^2*𝒮ʸ^2 + 4.0*𝒮ᶻ^4]
  stevens: (1/12)𝒮² + (1/9)𝒮⁴

````

However, the situation becomes more clear numerically, where all these complicated expressions turn out proportional to the identity matrix, similar to the representations of su(2):

````julia
println()
println("su(N) defining representations and their casimir values")
sun_cas = []
for S = (1/2):(1/2):3
  suN = stevens_basis(S)
  C = killing_casimir(suN)
  @assert allequal(diag(C))
  #@assert C ≈ (S*(S+1)/2) * I(Int64(2S+1))
  casimir = Float64(C[1,1])
  push!(sun_cas,casimir)
  println("S = $(Sunny.number_to_math_string(S)), Casimir diagonal = $casimir")
end
````

````

su(N) defining representations and their casimir values
S = 1/2, Casimir diagonal = 0.375
S = 1, Casimir diagonal = 0.444444444444
S = 3/2, Casimir diagonal = 0.46875
S = 2, Casimir diagonal = 0.48
S = 5/2, Casimir diagonal = 0.486111111111
S = 3, Casimir diagonal = 0.489795918367

````

The casimir value for su(N) can be predicted as $\frac{1}{2}\frac{N^2-1}{N^2}$, and it approaches $\frac{1}{2}$ as $N\to\infty$.
