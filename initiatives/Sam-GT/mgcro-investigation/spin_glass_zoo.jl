# A crystal (lattice with defined nearest neighbors) is called bipartite if its sites can be given labels A and B, such that 
# all nearest neighbors of every A site are B sites, and vice versa. This splits the lattice into two parts: the A part
# and the B part, with neither part being directly connected to itself by a nearest neighbor bond.

# One way to witness the bipartiteness of a crystal is to explicitly label the sites with 0 (A) and 1 (B).
# Then we can verify that every nearest neighbor bond connects an A-site to a B-site.

# Using this we can see that for medial lattice of the diamond crystal (known as the pyrochlore crystal),
# the polyhedra in question is a tetrahedron:

pyrochlore = medial_lattice(diamond)
view_crystal(pyrochlore)

# While for the laves graph it's corner-sharing triangles:

view_crystal(medial_lattice(laves))

# This feature of having a lattice of corner-sharing shapes enables interesting frustrated magnetic behavior to take place.

# ## Frustrated Magnetism on Corner-Sharing Networks
#
# What interactions are symmetry-allowed at the nearest neighbor level for this type of crystal?
# We can answer this on a case-by-case basis by checking the symmetry table:

print_symmetry_table(medial_lattice(diamond), 0.5)

# Here, we see that there is a two parameter space of allowed g-tensors, a one parameter space of allowed
# anisotropy (for $S < 2$, the higher stevens operators `O[4,x]` are zero), and a four parameter space of allowed
# J1 bilinear exchange matrix. (Total dimension = 7)
# We could also consider biquadratic exchanges, but Sunny doesn't (yet) provide a-priori symmetry analysis for them (it only checks
# they are symmetry allowed when setting the exchange).
#
# The Laves graph is slightly more complicated:

print_symmetry_table(medial_lattice(laves), 0.5)

# with three parameters of allowed g-tensor, two parameters of anisotropy, and six parameters of J1 matrix. (Total dimension = 11)
#
# ## G-factor
#
# For now, we only consider zero field, so the g-factor is immaterial.
# This makes our parameter space is a bit smaller.
#
# ## Anisotropy
#
# To understand the allowed anisotropy, we can use these functions to write them in the basis of spin matrices:

function dipolar_spin_matrix_coeffs(M;S)
  s = spin_matrices(S)
  [tr(S[i]' * M) / tr(S[i]' * S[i]) for i = 1:3]
end

function quadrupolar_spin_matrix_coeffs(M;S)
  s = spin_matrices(S)
  [tr((s[i] * s[j])' * M) / tr((s[i] * s[j])' * s[i] * s[j]) for i = 1:3, j = 1:3]
end

# For example, the allowed aniostropy (calculated for $S=1$) for the diamond crystal at the first site is $S^xS^y + S^yS^x - S^xS^z - S^zS^x - S^yS^z-S^zS^y$:

O = stevens_matrices(1)
quadrupolar_spin_matrix_coeffs(O[2,-2] -2O[2,-1] -2O[2,1],S=1)

# Comparing with the direction,

medial_bond_vectors(diamond)[1]

# of the bond on the diamond lattice which this site is placed on,
# we see that the anisotropy (which is nematic because it's quadrupolar) is aligned along the symmetry axis of the bond.
# If we set the sign of the anisotropy appropriately, we find that the ground state is Ising-like, with spins pointing either in or
# out of each tetrahedron:

sys_pyrochlore = System(medial_lattice(diamond),(1,1,1),[SpinInfo(1,S=1,g=2)],:dipole)
set_onsite_coupling!(sys_pyrochlore,-(O[2,-2] - 2O[2,-1] -2O[2,1]),1)
randomize_spins!(sys_pyrochlore)
minimize_energy!(sys_pyrochlore)
plot_spins(sys_pyrochlore)

# The opposite sign of anisotropy would make it easy-plane (in the reflection plane of the bond) instead of easy-axis (along the bond), as can be seen from the degenerate eigenvectors of the anisotropy matrix:

eigen(O[2,-2] - 2O[2,-1] - 2O[2,1])

# For the system derived from the Laves graph, on the site with bond vector

medial_bond_vectors(laves)[1]

# we can see that one of the flavors of anisotropy is either easy-plane in a plane containing the bond vector,
# or easy-axis in a direction perpendicular to the bond vector:

eigen(O[2,0] + 3O[2,2])

# and the other flips between two easy axes:

eigen(O[2,1])

# ## Bilinear exchange
# 
# So far, all sites were independent, so the ground states were just the easy-axis or easy-plane states, copied to every site.
# This means that there are a very large number ($2^N$ for the easy-axis case) of ground states.
# By introducing an exchange coupling between sites, we either select, modify, or hybridize between these non-interacting ground states, changing the ground state entropy.
# For simplicitly, we will mainly consider isotropic (Heisenberg) exchanges.
#
# For example, turning on a ferromagnetic J1 on top of the easy-axis anisotropy changes the entropy (number of possible ground states) as measured by the entropy of a single component of a spin on one site.
# Specifically, consider the ensemble of ground states of a unit cell of a pyrochlore with some fixed $J_1$ obtained by randomizing the spin configuration, and then "quenching" it by iteratively minimizing the energy:

# Using this ensemble, the spin on a given site is a random variable distributed according to the ensemble distribution.

# At $J_1 = 0$, there are just the two easy-axis states (bottom line), whereas at large ferromagnetic $J_1 < 0$, the four symmetry directions of the tetrahedra
# are all fully polarized ground states (middle line).
# Extending to antiferromagnetism ($J_1 > 0$) we find that at large $J_1$, the entropy is so large that it approaches the maximum entropy resolvable with our choice of histogram bins (dashed line).
# 
# The increase in entropy as $J_1$ is made slightly nonzero in either direction can be understood intuitively.
# In this limit, $J_1$ is much smaller than the anisotropy, so the energy landscape $E(\theta)$ experienced by 
# the angle $\theta$ away from the easy axis is mainly a quadratic minimum (due to the anisotropy).
# There is a small perturbation due to $J_1$, but the shift in the location of the minimum is proportional to the small
# quantity $J_1$/[anisotropy strength]. 
# Thus, the system decouples into the gross structure (frozen Ising spins with entropy $\log 2$) and the small interacting
# perturbations.
# The amplitude (and therefore the available phase space) of the perturbations is controlled by $\lvert J_1\rvert$, so increasing $J_1$ in either direction provides some entropy.
# As $J_1$ is increased further, the decoupling breaks down, and the entropy curve becomes nonlinear.
#
# To summarize: in the Ising limit $J_1\approx 0$, each site has entropy $\log 2$, with hybridization between sites (proportional to $\lvert J_1\rvert$) increasing the entropy experienced at any one site.
#
# ## Finite Temperature
#
# As is often the case in physics, it turns out that we are spending a fair bit
# of computational effort to get strongly into a limit which we don't care that strongly
# about in practice.
# In particular, much of the difficulty in computing entropy using the above method comes from
# sampling strictly over very many zero temperature "ground states" of the spin configuration.
# But who cares about zero temperature!? And who cares about a representative sampling of
# all possible ground state configurations, anyway?
#
# This is especially the case in the Ising limit, where the ground states are disconnected from each other by energy barriers. 
# Instead of doing that complicated sampling, let's just put the system in one ground state (arbitrarily selected) and let it cook:
